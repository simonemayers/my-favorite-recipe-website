        Pizza has been my favorite food since I was a child. It's a combination of all the foods I already love. I love bread especially thick fluffy bread.I love the nice crispiness on the outside and the soft chewiness on the inside. I also love cheese. But after becoming vegan I thought I wouldn't be able to eat pizza anymore but lucky there are amazing comapnies out there that worked hard to make a variety of great vegan cheese options! It have also made good vegan cheese from scratch at home! But just having bread and cheese can make the dish a little dry. So adding sauce especially a spicy red marinara sauce. The spicy red marinara sauce can also be made from scratch but I have never personally done that because there are so many cheap and delicious jared options. But all of those things combined make pizza my absolute favorite food.
