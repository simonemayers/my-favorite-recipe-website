    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Make a well in the center and pour in the lukewarm water. Mix to make a smooth dough. It might be a little sticky, it's ok.</li>
        <li>Cover with a damp kitchen towel and place in a warm spot for 15-20 minutes for the dough to rise.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a work surface lightly dusted with flour and knead for one minute until soft and springy.</li>
        <li>Generously grease a 10" cast iron pan with olive oil. Make sure to grease the sides and the base.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in the center and using your fingers, spread it evenly to the sides of the pan. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rest in a warm spot for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450F/230 C.</li>
        <li>While the oven is preheating, spread marinara on the pizza dough, and top with vegetables evenly. Finally, sprinkle some dried Italian herb seasoning.</li>
        <li>Onec the oven is preheated, place the cast iron pan on the stove on medium heat for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Immediately transfer pan to the hot oven and bake at 450F/230 C for 15 minutes. The vegetables must be wilted and cooked on the top and the base crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, and transfer to a wire rack for 5 minutes. Slice into wedges, sprinkle red pepper flakes to taste and serve hot.</li>
